If you don't have any Zaruba project, you can either clone an existing one or [create a new one](./create-a-project.md).

Once you have a project in your computer, you can either add components or run tasks.

# Add Components to Your Project

Before you can start any project, you need to create some zaruba scripts and application resources.

Here are several things you can:

* [add third party services](./add-third-party-service/README.md)
* [generate new application](./generate-new-application/README.md)
* [add subrepo to your project](./add-subrepo.md)
* [add runner for existing application](./add-runner-for-existing-application/README.md)
* [add application deployment](./add-application-deployment.md)

# Run Tasks

Once you have zaruba project with some zaruba scripts on it, you can start:

* [run applications locally](./run-applications-locally.md)
* [run some applications locally](./run-some-application-locally.md)
* [deploy application](./deploy-applications.md)
* [synchronize environment](./synchronize-environments.md)
