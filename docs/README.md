# üè† Zaruba Documentation

Hello, welcome to Zaruba's Documentation.

This documentation contains several subtopics. Each serves different purposes.

If you want to understand `zaruba script` specification, then you should visit the [core concept](core-concept/README.md).

If you need to see some examples about how to use Zaruba, then there is no better place than our [use cases](use-cases/README.md) section.

You may also need to see list of tasks Zaruba provide. In this case you should take a look at the [tasks](tasks/README.md) section.

Finally, you can also find Zaruba's design documents, RFCs and WIPs at the [design document](design-document/README.md) section.
