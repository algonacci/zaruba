# 🍺 Run a Single Task
<!--endTocHeader-->

You can run a single task by providing it's name.

There are two types of task:

* __Globally-accessible task__: You can execute these tasks from anywhere
* __Project-specific task__: You can only execute these tasks the [project](../core-concepts/project/README.md)'s directory.

# Run a Globally Accessible Task

To execute globally accessible task, you can invoke `zaruba please` from anywhere:

```bash
zaruba please <task-name>
```

__Example:__

<!--startCode-->
```bash
zaruba please clearLog
```
 
<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
 
```````

 By default, Zaruba provides some [builtin core tasks](../core-tasks/README.md) that are globally accessible.
 
 To make your tasks globally accessible, you need to add them to `ZARUBA_SCRIPTS` environment variable. Please refer to [zaruba configuration](../configuration.md) for more information.

# Run a Project Specific Task

To execute any project-specific tasks, you need to be in the project's directory first:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
zaruba please <task-name>
```

Please note that the command will not work from the project's subdirectory.

__Example:__

<!--startCode-->
```bash
cd examples/run-tasks
zaruba please printHelloWorld
```
 
<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
