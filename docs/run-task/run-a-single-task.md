# üç∫ Run a single task
<!--endTocHeader-->

You can run a specific task by knowing it's name.

There are two types of task:

* Builtin task: You can run these tasks from anywhere
* Project specific task: You should be in project's top level directory in order to execute these tasks.

# Run a Builitin Task

To execute builtin [core-tasks](../core-tasks/README.md), you can invoke `zaruba please` from anywhere:

```bash
zaruba please <task-name>
```

__Example:__

<!--startCode-->
```bash
zaruba please clearLog
```
 
<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
 
```````

# Run a Project Specific Task

But, to execute any [project](./project/README.md) specific tasks, you need to be in the project directory first:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
zaruba please <task-name>
```

__Example:__

<!--startCode-->
```bash
cd examples/tasks
zaruba please printHelloWorld
```
 
<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
 
```````
