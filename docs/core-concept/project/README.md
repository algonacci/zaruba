# 🏗️ Project

A project is a directory containing `index.zaruba.yaml`. Typically, a project is also a git repository.

You can create a project by creating an empty directory and invoking `zaruba please initProject`:

```bash
cd myproject
zaruba please initProject
```

Suppose someone already make a zaruba project and put it on git server, you can also clone it to your local computer.

Please look on [project anatomy](./project-anatomy.md) to see how a project is structured.
