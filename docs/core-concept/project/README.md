# 🏗️ Project

A project is a directory containing `index.zaruba.yaml`. Usually, a project is also a git repository.

To create a project you need to make an empty directory and invoke `zaruba please initProject`:

```bash
cd myproject
zaruba please initProject
```

You can also clone/fork existing projects from GitHub or other git servers.

Please look on [project anatomy](./project-anatomy.md) for more information.
