Zaruba is technology agnostic artefact generator. Zaruba take care about file dependencies and will do necessary action to maintain consistency in your project.

# Concept

Zaruba's main purpose is to help you generate, test, and probably deploy things faster.

Let's say you do a bit modification in your repository. Zaruba will automatically tell you whether your modification pass the unit-test or not. Then, it will copy the repository to dependant-services. Finally, it will do some service-test and integration test. Whenever everything is okay, it will generate docker images and deploy them to your kubernetes-development-cluster.

Using Zaruba, you can get that level of automation.

In order to achieve the purpose, zaruba needs `template` and `dependency tree`.

## Template

Template is basically bunch of text files. A `template` might contains `zaruba.template.yaml`.

Below is an example of template config

```yaml
# base mode
# invoked by performing `zaruba create <template> <target>
base:
  copy:
    readme.txt: readme.txt
    zaruba.ignore: zaruba.ignore
  modify:
    email/email.txt: email/email.txt
  hook:
    - 'echo "hello world" > hello.txt'
# special mode
# invoked by performing `zaruba create <template>:special <target>
special:
  copy:
    special.txt: special/special.txt
```

## Project

Project is zaruba's workspace. Zaruba will watch every changes you made in a project and perform several actions. You can provide the action by editing `dependency tree`.

A project might contains `zaruba.ignore` containing list of directory that should be ignored by `zaruba`.

## Dependency Tree (Hook File)

At root path of your project, you can have `zaruba.hook.yaml` containing an object with `files` property. The value of the `files` is a map.

The keys of the map are file/directory name, while it's values are objects containing two keys:

* `hooks`: list of actions before copy/delete files in `links`.
* `links`: list of files/directory that should has the same content as our file/directory

Below is a simple local-deployment-example:

```yaml
files:
    repos/ml-classifier:
        hook:
            - python -m pytest repos/ml-classifier
        link:
            - services/ner/repo/model
            - services/sentiment-analysis/repo/model
    services/ner:
        hook:
            - python -m pytest services/ner
            - docker build -t gofrendi/ner-service services/ner
    services/sentiment-analysis/:
        hook:
            - python -m pytest services/sentiment-analysis
            - docker build -t gofrendi/sentiment-analysis-service services/sentiment-analysis
```

You have two services `services/ner` and `services/sentiment-analysis`. These services need machine-learning model from `repos/ml-classifier`.

Everytime `repos/ml-classifier` edited, you want  both `services/ner` and `services/sentiment-analysis` are updated as well.

Finally, you want to run test and create docker image whenever those services updated.

# Command

## Create

```
zaruba create <template> <target>
```

Zaruba will copy a `template` into `target`. Depends on template's configuration, every `{{keyword}}` will be replaced by `keyword` envvar value.

## Watch

```
zaruba watch [project]
```

Zaruba will watch over your project. Detect any changes in your files, and perform necessary actions to maintain consistency.

For example, if you change a file in a repository, any services depend on the repository will be updated as well.
