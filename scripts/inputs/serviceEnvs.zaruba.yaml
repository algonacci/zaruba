    description: |
      Service environments, JSON formated.
      E.g: {"HTTP_PORT" : "3000", "MODE" : writer"}

      Many applications rely on environment variables to configure their behavior.
      You might need to see service's documentation or open environment files (.env, template.env, etc) to see available options.

      If there is no documentation/environment files available, you probably need to run-through the code or ask the developer team.
    prompt: "Service environments, JSON formated. E.g: {\"HTTP_PORT\" : \"3000\", \"MODE\" : \"writer\"}"
    validation: ^\{.*\}$
    default: "{}"
