  generatorTaskDependencies:
    description: |
      Task's dependencies, comma separated.
      E.g: runMysql, runRedis
      For example, you want to make sure that MySQL and Redis is already running before starting this task.
      In that case, assuming runMySql and runRedis are tasks to run MySQL and Redis respectively, then you need to set this task's dependencies into:
        runMysql,runRedis
    prompt: "Task dependencies"
